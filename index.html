		<p>Why so serious? Not clownâ€”Joker. I used to think my life was a tragedy, but now I realize it's a comedy.Is it just me or is it getting crazier out there? It's funny. When I was a little boy and told people I was going to be a comedian, everyone laughed at me. Well, no one's laughing now!I'm not good at future planning. I do not plan at all. Don't know what I'm doing tomorrow. Do not have a day planner and don't have a diary. I completely live in the now, not in the past, not in the future.I don't know why everyone is so rude, I don't know why you are; I don't want anything from you.I feel like I know you. I've been watching you forever. For my whole life, I didn't know if I even really existed. But I do, and people are starting to notice.The worst part of having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don't. I'm not political. I'm just trying to make people laugh. When you bring me out, can you introduce me as Joker</p>
